	/// <summary>
	/// the provider collection cannot be empty so this donothingprovider is intended so that at least one provider exists
	/// but also to provide some example code for those who wish to implement there own handlers.
	/// 
	/// For example if you sell products that require some kind of activation code, you could implement a custom handler
	/// to check the order for the product and if needed generate an activation key and email it to the customer
	/// 
	/// you would implement your own handler in your own class library project, compile it into a dll, put it in the /bin folder
	/// then create an xml file to declare your handler and put it in the /WebStore/OrderCompletedHandlers folder
	/// you will find an example xml file for this donothinghandler in that folder so you can see how to declare yours.
	/// 
	/// NOTE: all existing providers will be called for all orders after the payment is completed, not upon order creation
	/// for example if a user checks out with PayPal or google we will first get notification of the order having been received
	/// at that point an order is created but its status is OrderReceived.
	/// after the payment actually clears we get another notification from PayPal or Google and at this point the order status will be set to fulfillable
	/// and the ordercompleted event handlers will be fired, passing in the order as an event argument.
	/// It is also possible that the order could be cancelled at PayPal or Google before payment is cleared, therefore we wait 
	/// until payment has cleared before firing the order completed handlers.
	///
